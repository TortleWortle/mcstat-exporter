# Minecraft Stat Counters

A little project to automatically player stats to txt files for easy use with obs.

## usage
`./mcstat-exporter -dir MyWorldStats -file [path to world]/stats/[uuid].json`

[ ] Checking wether files are different before writing
[ ] Config for what stats to load. (Wildcards?)
